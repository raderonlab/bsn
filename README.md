# BSN Software Pre-Release, Beta Version

Light curve analysis of contact binary systems using existing programs and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method
or Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is generally a time-consuming process. There were some suggestions for this problem, which
cannot be a simple solution for users. In this study, we introduce the BSN software for the analysis of light curves of contact
binary systems, which has a fast MCMC speed and can achieve the desired answers in less than a day. BSN software offers more
features and is easier to use for analyzing the light curve on ground- or space-based data, taking into consideration scientific
principles. Additionally, we presented light curve solutions for 20 selected contact systems using TESS data based on BSN
software. The selection of these systems was based on the appropriate interval of the orbital period, the temperature range of the
stars, and whether the light curves were symmetrical or asymmetrical. The estimation of the absolute parameters of the selected
systems was presented using Gaia DR3 parallax and in the form of BSN software. We provided an example of light curves, a 3D
image of the system, and a heat-map on the cornet plot obtained from the MCMC process.
