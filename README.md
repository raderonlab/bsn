# BSN Software Pre-Release, Beta Version

The process of analyzing light curves in contact binary systems utilizing established programs and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method or Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is often characterized by a significant investment of time. Several recommendations were proposed for this issue, indicating that finding a straightforward solution may be challenging for consumers. This paper presents the introduction of the BSN program, designed for the analysis of light curves in contact binary systems. The software exhibits a high-speed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, enabling the attainment of desired results within a timeframe of less than 24 hours. The BSN program provides a greater range of functions and offers enhanced usability for the analysis of light curves derived from ground- or space-based data, while also incorporating scientific concepts. Furthermore, we have provided light curve solutions for a total of 20 chosen contact systems by utilizing TESS data and relying on the BSN program. The systems were chosen based on the suitable orbital period interval, the temperature range of the stars, and the symmetry or asymmetry of their light curves. The determination of the precise values of the fundamental characteristics of the chosen systems was conducted by utilizing the Gaia DR3 parallax and employing the BSN program. We presented a demonstration of light curves, a three-dimensional representation of the system, and a heat map on the cornet plot derived from the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure.
